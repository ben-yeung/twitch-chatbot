## Simple chat bot to interact with users in Twitch chat and provide moderation
- Uses [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js) for Twitch integration
- Simple starter greeting command, flip coin command, and some relevant streamer information
- Some moderation features include automatic message deletion based on blacklist of words
    - Note that API / CLIENT keys and secrets are hidden in a botconfig.json file
    - This file also includes an array of blacklisted words (be sure to make your own for moderating)
    - Feel free to also use a .env file and change the respective botconfig references

##  üéß Spotify Web API Integration
- Using Authorization Code Flow with various scopes to make GET and POST requests
- Twitch chat commands to modify playback (moderator permission options)
    - Command to grab song currently playing in real time
    - Command to skip current song
    - Command to add a song to Spotify queue
- Examples of Client Credentials Flow and Authorization Code Flow
    - Maintaining access and refresh tokens to ensure authorized requests
    - Chaining requests and outputting relevant data to Twitch stream chat
- Note that request urls are hidden in a botconfig.json file as some contain private information
    - Be sure to update or include the relevant url calls accordingly
- Once a refresh token has been generated, schedule access token refreshes with cron
