#  twitch-chatbot ðŸ¤–
Simple chatbot to interact with users in Twitch chats and provide additional commands
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for compilation and package managing
- Uses [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js) for Twitch integration
- Simple starter greeting command, flip coin command, and some relevant streamer information
- Some moderation features include automatic message deletion based on blacklist of words
    - Note that API / CLIENT keys and secrets are hidden in a botconfig.json file
    - This file also includes an array of blacklisted words.
    - Feel free to also use a .env file and change the respective botconfig references
